# App Summary
My app idea is _`my_app_name`_. It will do all the things and it will be awesome! Your notes.md doesn't need to be as formatted as this example. What's most important is that you get your ideas down.

##### Below are the detailed specifications for the Rails Assessment. Try to answer them as best you can. Again, no worries if you arent sure on a particular item - We can talk about it together!

#### Specs:
- [x] Using Ruby on Rails for the project
  <br>

- [ ] Include at least one has_many relationship
  * Example of one has_many relationship (e.g. x has_many y; User has_many Posts)
  <br>

- [ ] Include at least one belongs_to relationship
  * Example of one belongs_to relationship (e.g. y belongs_to x; e.g. Post belongs_to User)
  <br>

- [ ] Include at least two has_many through relationships
  * Example of one belongs_to relationship (e.g. x has_many z through y; e.g. User has_many Categories through Posts)
  <br>

- [ ] Include at least one many-to-many relationship
  * Example of many to many relationship (e.g. x has_many y through z, y has_many x through z; (e.g. User has_many Categories through Posts, Categories has_many Users through Posts)
  <br>

- [ ] The "through" part of the has_many through includes at least one user submittable
  * attribute, that is to say, some attribute other than its foreign keys that can be submitted by the app's user (think attribute_name e.g. post.title)
  <br>

  * list of model objects with validations e.g. User, Post, Category (see above)
  <br>
